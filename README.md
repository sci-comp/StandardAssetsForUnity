# Standard Assets for Unity

## Introduction

These standard assets which I include in most of my projects.

This set of assets was put together with a third person RPG in mind, though it could be adapted for other game types.

## Dependencies

A Texture Array Configuration and material for MicroSplat is included, though you will need to acquire the MicroSplat shader file from the Unity Asset Store.
