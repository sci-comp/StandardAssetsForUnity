# Standard Assets for Unity

## Introduction

These are standard assets that I include in most of my projects. Though this package was put together with a third person RPG in mind, it could be helpful for other genres as well.

This package is under the MIT license (with some content originally from the public domain). This license was chosen so that you can grab what you need with the least amount of hassle possible.


## Dependencies

A Texture Array Configuration and material for MicroSplat is included, though you will need to acquire the MicroSplat shader file from the Unity Asset Store.

- MicroSplat [link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/microsplat-96478)
- MicroSplat URP 2022 [link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/microsplat-urp-2022-support-244845)

If you do not want to use this dependency, simply delete the included MicroSplat folder, then replace the demo terrain's material with your favorite shader.
