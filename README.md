# Standard Assets for Unity

## Introduction

These are standard assets that I include in most of my projects. Though this package was put together with a third person RPG in mind, it could be helpful for other genres as well.

### Required Dependency

### Optional Dependencies

These are proprietary assets that I currently use. Many users do not like proprietary assets, so I have included instruction here on how to remove these dependencies. However, by default, this StandardAssets package assumes these dependencies have already been included.

#### MicroSplat

Direcory StandardAssets/Art/MicroSplat includes a Texture Array Configuration and material for MicroSplat, though you will need to acquire the MicroSplat shader file from the Unity Asset Store.

If you do not want to use this dependency, simply delete the MicroSplat folder, then update the demo terrain's material with your favorite terrain shader.
